# SrF-Lab-Control

This is a generic program designed to interface with multiple devices at the same time. A device can be added by importing a configuration file (.ini) and a driver file (.py). Different modules — device threads, monitor, HDF writer, plotter, sequencer, etc — work together to meet data acquiring needs in atomic, molecular and optical (AMO) physics experiments. Since the original repository [CeNTREX](https://github.com/js216/CeNTREX) has included an elaborate document, here I only focus on 2 subtle things, (1) requirement of device configuration file and driver file, which is fundamental but confusing for first-timer users, and (2) the sequencer, which is not mentioned in the [CeNTREX](https://github.com/js216/CeNTREX) document and also looks very different in this program.
